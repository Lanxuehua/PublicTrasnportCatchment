# Travel-Catchment

Activity centres is one of the Melbourne 2030 strategies for urban growth. Melbourne 2030 emphasizes the important of activity centres to ensure the urban growth to be sustainable. It is the goal of Activity centres to reduce congestion, to provide Accessibility and social equity to residents. This is not the first time Melbourne implement activity centres plan. Melbourne had adopted the district centre policy in 1980s, but later it was abandoned because government made way for shopping centres. One of the criticisms is that the development of activity centres is not consistent with the construct of public transport. Without efficient public transport, 75% of trips to Melbourne activity centres were by car. Therefore, it is meaningful to assess the share of public transport for current Melbourne 2030 designated activity centres. This study used an isochrones approach to identify the differences of driving and public transit in the Metropolitan Melbourne designated activity centres, and identified the multiple of private-public travel mode share significantly affected by the multiple of private-public catchment population.
