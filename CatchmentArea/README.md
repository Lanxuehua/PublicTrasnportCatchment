# Catchment mapping

Travel Time were used in the project for isochrones mapping in major city central area, such as Sydeny Central and Melbourne Central.
For detailed analysis in Melbourne, Remix (https://www.remix.com/) was used for public transport mapping, because some of the bus routes are not recorded in Travel Time. 
The map per below shows 30 minutes public transport catchment area for each activities centers in Metropolitan Melbourne, using Remix and TravelTime respectively.
The differences revealed the facts that bus routes were missing, and this caused a huge differences in Doncaster area.
